/**
 * From the names the drivers use to the aggregates behind them. A request model carries
 * a member's name, a copy's number, or a book's title, which is what a line of text, a
 * dialog, or a URL can carry, and the use case has to find the aggregate behind each
 * one; a name nobody has is a refusal. Three use cases look up a member, three a copy,
 * one a book, and two the loan of a copy, so the four lookups are written here once.
 * This is a helper and not a use case: it has no state, and it belongs to no package
 * below this one because several of them need it.
