 * {@code ForLendingCopies} had three. The request says which member and which copy;
 * the output is the presenter that will be told what happened, handed in with each
 * call, because the window and the endpoint share one use case and show its answer in
 * different places. A refused command ends in a {@code Refusal} and the output hears
 * nothing.
