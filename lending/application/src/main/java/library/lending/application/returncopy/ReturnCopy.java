/**
 * Return a copy. A use case, and the class behind the {@link ReturnCopyInput} boundary.
 * It finds the copy and the loan behind the number, asks {@link Lending} to take the
 * copy back, tells the member the copy is now held for, if there is one, through the
 * {@link Notifier} port, rings the {@link ChangeSignal}, and presents who returned
 * what, how late, what they owe now, and whom the copy waits for. The model refuses
 * nothing here: a copy that is not on loan is caught while looking for its loan.
